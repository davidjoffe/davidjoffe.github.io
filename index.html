<h2>More of my projects:</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://djoffe.com/dj-software/runai"><strong>runai</strong> is an AI/LLM task automation helper</a> — designed as an “AI extension” of the terminal.
  Once installed in your PATH, it can be invoked from any directory to run context-aware tasks such as code refactoring,
  batch source or content generation, and other automated workflows, using pluggable backends including local models
  and optional AutoGen multi-agent collaboration.

  <a href="https://github.com/djsoftware1/foreach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>for-each</strong></a> — a small cross-platform command-line utility to “run a given command once per line”.
</p>

<p>I have 30 years+ experience doing cross-platform development for Linux, Windows and more, and also developed a cross-platform open source C++ game that has been included in <b>official Debian</b> Linux.</p>

  <h2>Open Space Federation (OSF)</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Open-Space-Federation">Open Space Federation</a> is a long-horizon “thought-space” about openness and the future. We already benefit from open
    source software, open hardware, open robotics, open datasets, and even open CPU designs — built through the work of
    many individuals over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Could openness someday extend to space tech too? Open spacecraft designs? Open habitats? Open tools and methods for
    building (and iterating) beyond Earth?
  </p>
  <p>
    OSF is intentionally lightweight: a place to plant ideas and explore what “open” could mean for space-related
    technologies — without becoming a centralized organization.

<section id="tlex" class="project">
  <h2>TLex Dictionary Production Software</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://tshwanedje.com/tshwanelex/">TLex</a> is professional lexicography software for producing high-quality dictionaries across languages and publishing
    targets: web, mobile, print, digital and API. It supports standards-based workflows (Unicode, XML, XLIFF, TMX, TBX,
    XSLT), is cross-platform, and is designed to be scalable and highly customizable — from small projects to very large databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    It includes productivity and quality features that help prevent common dictionary-production errors (e.g. automated
    numbering, integrity checks, smart cross-references), plus time-saving tooling for real-world editorial workflows.
    TLex is used by major publishers and institutions, and supports both team and individual workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent and ongoing work also explores integrated AI/LLM assistance and automation inside the tooling and publishing
    pipelines (including support for both cloud and local backends).

<section id="tlterm" class="project">
  <h2><a href="https://tshwanedje.com/terminology/">tlTerm Terminology Software</a></h2>
  <p>
    tlTerm is a terminology management environment for building, editing, and publishing terminology datasets in a
    standards-based way. It supports multilingual terminology work and integrates into broader publishing pipelines for
    web and digital platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like TLex, tlTerm emphasizes quality, consistency, and scalability: structured data models, flexible import/export,
    and tooling that supports real terminology workflows in teams and organizations.
